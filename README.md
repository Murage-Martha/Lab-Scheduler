# Lab Scheduler
 The USIU Lab Schedule Generator is a Flask web application designed to automate the assignment of labs to classes in a university course schedule. It takes a CSV file containing course schedule data as input, processes the data to assign labs to classes, and generates a lab schedule that can be viewed on the web.
